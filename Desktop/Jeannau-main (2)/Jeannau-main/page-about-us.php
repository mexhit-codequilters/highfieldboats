                                                At Jeanneau, our story begins with Henry Jeanneau's passion for the sea and his unwavering commitment to craftsmanship. What started as a dream to build the perfect boat has evolved into a legacy of innovation and excellence. From our headquarters in Les Herbiers, France, we have been creating exceptional sailing and motor yachts that embody the French art of living on the water. Our journey is one of continuous evolution, always pushing the boundaries of design and technology.
